To best support any child with dyslexia, a robust assessment is the foundation. Then, each child’s personal needs need to be addressed in a multisensory, structured, and accumulative way. To say it simply- I always plan a well-thought-out program with specific targets, depending on the priorities of the child. This way, the skills will stay in the long-term memory. Another aspect is the technical knowledge and effective use of assistive technology. And lastly- the lessons need to be meaningful for the student. I strive to get to know the child and their interests to make the lessons most productive."

To build their confidence, it is important to make teaching relevant to their interests and learning styles, following their natural way of learning and strengthening the areas for improvement.  I devised carefully paced, scaffolded tasks, supported by embedded visuals, 3D props, mindful breaks, and self-reflection summaries. This way, the students consciously participate in their learning, reflect on it, and can see immediate progress, thus boosting their confidence. It is vital that the teaching is also structured and cumulative to support the long-term memory of the students."

To additionally improve students’ concentration, a range of sensory and mindfulness tools can be used: short, carefully structured tasks, active or mindful rest breaks, and various props. Creating a sensory profile of each pupil helps to discover the most helpful tools."
