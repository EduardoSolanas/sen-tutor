                "Dyslexia is my main specialism and I have worked in schools specialising in supporting students with dyslexia in both state and independent sectors. To best support any child with dyslexia, a robust assessment is the foundation. Then, each child’s personal needs need to be addressed in a multisensory, structured, and accumulative way. To say it simply- I always plan a well-thought-out program with specific targets, depending on the priorities of the child. This way, the skills will stay in the long-term memory. Another aspect is the technical knowledge and effective use of assistive technology. And lastly- the lessons need to be meaningful for the student. I strive to get to know the child and their interests to make the lessons most productive.",

Unfortunately, the exam mode is mainly written- which does not make things easier. If the student has access arrangements in place, they may have a scribe or speech-to-text software available for the exams. In other cases, it may be worth talking to SENCO about it.",
                "Staged practice with specific software/scribe may be a starting point. If there is no access given, then pair writing is a starting point- where a student contributes and the teacher scribes. With time and specific writing frames, the student contributes more. This is followed up by carefully arranged timed writing. Praising and celebrating success is very important, as well as consistency and the student taking ownership.",
                "Motivating can be sometimes hard- hence the choice of topics should address students’ interests and allow them to shine (e.g. for a student interested in science, we would watch a short film on a recent discovery, discuss it and then write a purposeful article/letter/take part ina  written competition- that can be even sent to a relevant body, etc.",

                "During online teaching, it is vital to see the student working and to apply activities that allow the teacher to see the student’s real-time progress, such as working in Google Docs, participating in online games, quizzes and other interactive activities that are available via screen share. Liaison with the parents often brings positive effects to maintaining students’ motivation through positive feedback or by establishing a clear reward system at home.

Since most exams require good quality of writing, higher-functioning autistic students often need specific assistance with various types of writing, stressing supportive practice with feedback.",

                "When working with autistic students, I learned that it is incredibly important to remember how positive rapport and an individualised approach can turn a corner for a young person with very unique and specific strengths. Longitudinal studies conducted at UCLH proved that young people with autism give relationships the highest meaning. This also sometimes means that the match between the tutor and the student has to be carefully considered or even reconsidered.",

                "Anxiety is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear. Depending on the severity, it is very important to recognise the source of anxiety and to build a step-by-step- plan to overcome it. Usually, accepting our feelings and then seeing small, staged successes related to the source of anxiety, is the very first step to overcoming the feeling. E.g. with exam anxiety, well-organised preparation and getting through past papers successfully in exam conditions, then through the first exam, usually reduces the anxiety",
                "It is important to recognise and celebrate successes along the way and to find strategies that will work in completing the task that causes anxiety.

                " From the academic point of view, I see my role as an enabler, but also a coach where the student reflects on his way and the process of learning, which is called metacognition. By asking and answering some empowering questions, e.g. what do I know already? what do I want to improve? what I am already doing to help myself and how I can make things better?; or, even- why am I doing this?- the student is in the centre and control of the process",
                "This good start leads to careful planning where the student is also at the centre of decision-making (tutor-led) and, eventually, evaluates their progress each session. the students learn to know the power of ‘yet’ and they can see when ‘I don’t know this yet’ becomes ‘I know this already. Let’s do some more! Establishing an effective reward system is also sometimes necessary, but, for a student that has been struggling with a subject for a long time, seeing their progress is often a big enough reward.",

                "Working with a wide range of SEN students, especially with ADHD, ADD and ASD, I am familiar with various aspects of challenges with executive functioning skills, such as having trouble starting and/or completing tasks, prioritizing tasks, forgetting what has been said, heard or read, trouble in following directions or a sequence of steps,  panicking when rules or routines change, having trouble switching focus from one task to another, getting overly emotional and fixated on things and struggling to organise their thoughts, managing time or keep track of their belongings.",

                "Jacob - GCSE maths: Jacob found several areas of maths challenging. He was autistic, lacked full understanding, and doubted his ability. We worked through his knowledge gaps and tricky aspects of the topics to give him an excellent base to work. Then we moved on to more advanced work, which I made multi-sensory, fun, and interactive, in line with his ASD profile. He moved from borderline 5/6 to a 7.",
                "Sandra - GCSE English Language: Sandra, in line with her ASC spectrum, struggled with expressing herself in writing. She wasn’t able to structure her text or make up a storyline that would reflect her ideas accurately. We worked on her planning skills as well as vocabulary and sentence structure to write coherent paragraphs. She also struggled with bringing adequate evidence to her analysis, so she learned the techniques to work with the text efficiently and embed it into PEE paragraphs.",
                "Zak: Zak struggled with ADHD, mostly with a lack of concentration, and found it very difficult to focus in class. I helped him with the organisation of his work, homework, and any bits of classwork he had not been able to finish. I made lessons as interactive as possible but stuck to a clear routine, including breaks, so he felt confident each time we had a session.",

                "I worked with partially visually impaired students (please see a review from Nadezda). The main focus of our learning has been on building rapport and prioritising subjects that needed the most attention in a student-friendly way: starting from appropriate communication, adapting resources, including making sure the student wears their glasses and has the work accessible (technology, enlarged font, screen magnification, specific colour and texture, personalised adaptation and organisation of work and space, making sure they wore glasses), very often addressing various anxieties, focusing on oral work and presentations and implementing technology when possible (e.g. touch-typing, text to speech and vice-versa).",
                "VI students often struggle with confidence and friendships. Therefore sensitive and skillful communication as well as being included in decision-making and feeling just like everyone else is an important part of the process.  If possible, coordination with the school is always advisable.",

                "Apart from using classic ASD techniques, like social stories and comic strip conversations, or more advanced communication techniques (like communication cards, visuals, Makaton, Pecs), it is important to remember that each child is different and there may be different reasons why they struggle to communicate. In each case, various situations require rehearsing the anticipated scenario or analysing and redesigning a scenario that caused difficulty, often including the development of the child’s speech fluency, together with their vocabulary.",
                "Sometimes support from a qualified psychologist may be advisable, especially when mental health difficulties are in the picture.  It is important to mediate in any difficulties and also to ensure that this is done in a sensitive, or sometimes- a confidential manner. Rewarding each step is another important part to ensure the consistency of a child’s effort.",

                "Most of the students I teach show processing difficulties. To build their confidence, it is important to make teaching relevant to their interests and learning styles, following their natural way of learning and strengthening the areas for improvement.  I devised carefully paced, scaffolded tasks, supported by embedded visuals, 3D props, mindful breaks, and self-reflection summaries. This way, the students consciously participate in their learning, reflect on it, and can see immediate progress, thus boosting their confidence. It is vital that the teaching is also structured and cumulative to support the long-term memory of the students.",

                "I have mentioned metacognition as a very important part of the learning process, that supports motivation to learn through carefully posed questions. This way the student is taking over their learning. This thus leads to growing independence in the whole process. Through regular, step-by-step self-evaluation, the students take charge and responsibility for their learning. Sometimes the breaking point is letting the student win a few quizzes with rewards and having a goal each time. But long-term, it is about the student making a conscious decision to be responsible for their learning. Of course, the tutor needs to gain the students’ acceptance and trust first, which sometimes takes a while. To break down the ice, I am trying to know my tutees’ passions, dreams, plans for the future, strengths and challenges. Then my role revolves around making the learning experience unique and fun to unlock their potential in a multi-sensory, structured way.",

                "I tend to assess students’ skills through an informal discussion of a social situation (e.g. in a shared video) and lead them onto their personal experiences. We then focus on the tricky areas and work through charts based on the ”Talkabout” programme or my own resources developed over the years of experience working with ASD and SEN students.",

Typically, I run a study skills checklist and we then focus on seeing the pictures and setting the priorities. I usually get the full picture of a student from their school if possible and liaise with the teachers. The students then develop their ways: starting with a skilful goal-setting, through the effective planning of their learning, creating a stable and well-organized learning environment, revision tools, and developing effective reading, planning, and writing techniques.

Cornell method), planning and structuring techniques, structuring a paragraph, maintaining the flow (key vocabulary and cohesive devices), introductions and conclusions, proofreading skills (secretarial and authorial), non-fiction writing.",

Since September, he has become the top-performing student in his set, aspiring now for grade 5, rather than 3 or 4, due to a carefully organised study and revision schedule. You can find the details in the review below.",
                "The key that works for all students is that the teaching is multisensory, structured, and cumulative: firstly, the targeted areas are broken down and adapted to apply to a student’s learning style (assessed), using concrete and multisensory tools; secondly, the learning is progressive using a similar- but not repetitive- adapted structure to each lesson; lastly, the teaching is cumulative- each lesson ties and revises the previous one, with specific intervals over 30 days; it also anticipates the follow-up, showing the student the big picture, including the student’s strengths and needs.",

Jasmine sat entry examinations for three schools, with all students going on to one of their preferred secondary/boarding schools.  Jasmine, 11+ maths: Jasmine is severely dyscalculic, she struggled with her general maths skills (including timetables) and applying theory to practice. We steadily worked on building up her confidence, understanding, and exam technique. She was offered a place at Kew House. Conrad, 11+ English: Conrad has dyslexia and found it difficult to extract and then implement information from the text in his writing. His focus, processing, and writing speed were low. We suggested typing sessions which-at completion- sharply improved his writing speed — we steadily built-in techniques for time-efficient reading and planning a correctly structured written response. As a result, he moved up a set within a term in Year 5.",
                "GCSE English/Mathematics (SEN): I have worked with several exam boards (Edexcel, AQA, WJEC) for GCSE/ Functional Skills/ AQA. I have helped many students move from 2/3/4 to 3/4/5/6. For students at the lower end of the grade, the focus is on learning content and attaining a firm understanding as well as application.",
