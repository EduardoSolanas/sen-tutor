                    <p class="testimony">Our daughter is high functioning ASD, but was struggling with note taking and revision for her A-levels after missing the GCSE exam experience due to Covid-19 arrangements. The tutor we chose, Ewa, has made a huge difference, with over a 1-grade jump in predicted grades within a term. Whilst more expensive than normal tutors, the SENCO experience of the tutors means they know how to approach both our daughter and her school, which has been invaluable. The process of choosing a tutor is well supported and advised, with a good choice available to us, each with their own strengths. The tutorials are online which suits our daughter, and the tutor clearly prepares well, coordinating with the school and communicating regularly with our child, setting work to be done between sessions. We would definitely recommend Sensational Tutors to other parents of children with learning differences.</p>

                    <p class="testimony">Ewa is such a talented and supportive tutor with endless patience. My son is in year 11 and is currently studying to take his GCSE maths next year. He struggles with concentration and memory and it affects his confidence massively but he has been working with Ewa once a week for several months and his confidence and ability have soared already. His school work and test results are continually improving and his school teacher has even noticed his improved confidence. He is now getting praise points in maths instead of detentions! To me the most important part is that my son really likes Ewa. He says she's easy to speak to so he isn't worried about asking questions, and if he gets something wrong he says she's really helpful and explains again. High praise from a very shy socially awkward boy who struggles to connect with people he doesn't know. I can't recommend Ewa highly enough worthy of 10 stars in my eyes</p>

                    <p class="testimony">Ewa has been my daughter’s tutor for the period of 18 months. Ewa covered a variety of subjects with her, amongst those were: English, essay writing, chemistry, biology and physics, while working with my daughter 4 hours every week. My daughter has additional needs, hence Ewa’s expertise and her support were essential in my daughter’s progress. She has cerebral palsy and she is visually impaired, she is dyslexic and dyspraxic, and has a problem with short therm memory. Ewa’s work was essential and my daughter managed to improve and to catch up with her peers. During COVID 19 and the lockdown, all the lessons were on Zoom and Teams, with interactive whiteboard, live lessons which my daughter found easy to follow. At the time, my daughter was a pupil in one of the independent senior schools in London (age 13-14). I am forever grateful for all her help and support that she provided for my daughter.</p>

                    <p class="testimony">Ewa has been so helpful with my son, currently in the first year of sixth form. He has aspergers and ADHD and struggles with organisation and study techniques, finding it difficult to focus. Ewa is patient, committed and highly skilled at breaking daunting homework tasks down into small steps. She is always supportive and looking for ways to make a difference.</p>

                    <p class="testimony">Ewa is highly experienced in all areas of special needs, in particular ASD and Dyslexia. She sets very high standards for her pupils, prepares meticulously and is able to motivate the most reluctant learners. She is highly professional and committed. She is also extremely skilled and trained in speech and language. Highly recommended.</p>

                    <p class="testimony">Ewa is a lovely kind and patient tutor that has been working with my 13 year old son, 3 times a week for the past 4 months. Under Ewa’s thoughtful and skilled tutelage he has progressed nicely and is much more confident as a result. I would highly recommend Ewa. 5 stars !</p>
