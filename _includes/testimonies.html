                    <p class="testimony">Our daughter is high functioning ASD, but was
                        struggling with note taking and revision for her A-levels after missing the GCSE exam experience due
                        to
                        Covid-19 arrangements. The tutor we chose, Ewa, has made a huge difference, with over a 1-grade jump
                        in
                        predicted grades within a term.</p>
                    <p>Whilst more expensive than normal tutors, the SENCO experience of
                        the
                        tutors means they know how to approach both our daughter and her school, which has been invaluable.
                        The
                        process of choosing a tutor is well supported and advised, with a good choice available to us, each
                        with
                        their own strengths.</p>
                    <p>The tutorials are online which suits our daughter, and the tutor clearly
                        prepares
                        well, coordinating with the school and communicating regularly with our child, setting work to be
                        done
                        between sessions. We would definitely recommend Sensational Tutors to other parents of children with
                        learning differences.</p>

                    <p class="testimony">Ewa is such a talented and supportive tutor with
                        endless patience. My son is in year 11 and is currently studying to take his GCSE maths next year.
                        He
                        struggles with concentration and memory and it affects his confidence massively but he has been
                        working
                        with Ewa once a week for several months and his confidence and ability have soared already. His
                        school
                        work and test results are continually improving and his school teacher has even noticed his improved
                        confidence.</p>
                    <p>He is now getting praise points in maths instead of detentions! To me the most important
                        part is that my son really likes Ewa. He says she's easy to speak to so he isn't worried about
                        asking
                        questions, and if he gets something wrong he says she's really helpful and explains again. High
                        praise
                        from a very shy socially awkward boy who struggles to connect with people he doesn't know. I can't
                        recommend Ewa highly enough worthy of 10 stars in my eyes</p>

                    <p class="testimony">Ewa has been my daughter’s tutor for the period of 18
                        months. Ewa covered a variety of subjects with her, amongst those were: English, essay writing,
                        chemistry, biology and physics, while working with my daughter 4 hours every week. My daughter has
                        additional needs, hence Ewa’s expertise and her support were essential in my daughter’s progress.
                        She
                        has cerebral palsy and she is visually impaired, she is dyslexic and dyspraxic, and has a problem
                        with
                        short therm memory.</p>
                    <p>Ewa’s work was essential and my daughter managed to improve and to catch up with
                        her
                        peers. During COVID 19 and the lockdown, all the lessons were on Zoom and Teams, with interactive
                        whiteboard, live lessons which my daughter found easy to follow. At the time, my daughter was a
                        pupil in
                        one of the independent senior schools in London (age 13-14). I am forever grateful for all her help
                        and
                        support that she provided for my daughter.</p>

                        first year of sixth form. He has aspergers and ADHD and struggles with organisation and study
                        techniques, finding it difficult to focus.</p>
                    <p>Ewa is patient, committed and highly skilled at breaking
                        daunting homework tasks down into small steps. She is always supportive and looking for ways to make
                        a difference.</p>

                    <p>She sets very high standards for her pupils, prepares
                        meticulously and is able to motivate the most reluctant learners. She is highly professional and

                    <p>Under Ewa’s thoughtful and skilled tutelage he has progressed nicely and is much more confident as a
