                    <p>General • KS1-KS4 support • Experience teaching primarily SEND students: SpLD- dyslexia, visual

                    <p>My experience teaching students with SEN: For the past 14 years I have been supporting children
                        and young people aged 5 to 16 with additional learning needs, including communication, memory,
                        phonics, reading, spelling, literacy and numeracy difficulties in various subjects: English,
                        Maths, Science, and others, where relevant.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>I have experienced and observed teaching in both primary and secondary sectors, and taught SEN
                        students in a mainstream and independent setting (both mainstream and special schools), based on
                        specialist SEN training in specific learning difficulties- dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia,
                        ADHD, and speech and language. This goes in line with as an extensive cooperation with
                        educational psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and other
                        school professionals. I specifically try to keep the parents in the loop along the way- any
                        decision-making needs to tie with mutual understanding and support. My teaching was rated as
                        good, or outstanding in internal and internal inspections.</p>
