                    <p>General Support and Specialized Instruction for SEN Students:</p>
                    <p>I offer comprehensive educational support across all key stages, from KS1 to KS4, with a specialized focus on students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). My expertise encompasses a broad spectrum of learning challenges including Specific Learning Difficulties (SpLD) such as dyslexia, visual impairments, dyscalculia, processing issues, dyspraxia, ADD, ADHD; conditions like Autism, and various speech and language difficulties, as well as profound learning challenges like Global Developmental Delay and Cerebral Palsy. I am also experienced in bolstering literacy and numeracy skills and addressing emotional difficulties students may face. In addition, I provide guidance in revision planning, study skills, and strategies for effective learning.</p>

                    <p>SEN Teaching Background:</p>
                    <p>With 14 years dedicated to nurturing children and adolescents between 5 to 16 years old, I have honed my skills in addressing a multitude of additional learning needs. These include aiding development in communication, memory, phonics, reading, spelling, and foundational academic skills across core subjects such as English, Mathematics, and Science.</p>
                    <p>My practical experience extends to both primary and secondary educational settings, where I have implemented SEN strategies in both mainstream environments and specialized institutions. My methods are informed by comprehensive SEN training focused on distinct learning challenges such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, ADHD, and speech and language impairments, augmented by close collaboration with educational psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and other educational experts.</p>

                    <p>Parental Engagement:</p>
                    <p>I prioritize parental involvement, recognizing that effective education is a collaborative effort that requires open communication and shared decision-making with families. This philosophy has been reflected in consistently high evaluations of my teaching, which has been recognized as good or outstanding in various assessments.</p>
