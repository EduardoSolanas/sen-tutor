                    <p>My experience teaching students with SEN: For the past 14 years I have been supporting children
                        and young people aged 5 to 16 with additional learning needs, including communication, memory,
                        phonics, reading, spelling, literacy and numeracy difficulties in various subjects: English,
                        Maths, Science, and others, where relevant.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>I have experienced and observed teaching in both primary and secondary sectors, and taught SEN
                        students in a mainstream and independent setting (both mainstream and special schools), based on
                        specialist SEN training in specific learning difficulties- dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia,
                        ADHD, and speech and language. This goes in line with as an extensive cooperation with
                        educational psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and other
                        school professionals. I specifically try to keep the parents in the loop along the way- any
                        decision-making needs to tie with mutual understanding and support. My teaching was rated as
                        good, or outstanding in internal and internal inspections.</p>

                    <h3>My Teaching Philosophy</h3>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Each child has a right to strive. Each child has a right to be listened to. Each child has a
                        right to be respected.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>My teaching philosophy is very much about breaking barriers to learning through a holistic
                        approach and personalised, targeted intervention, based on robust training and skilful choice of
                        resources and appropriate instruction.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>I am very thankful that I have spent the first years of my teaching career in a school that
                        allowed me to grow, thrive and challenge my teaching practices. When I began, I supported
                        students with specific learning difficulties both as a teacher and a class support assistant.
                        This allowed me to see various teaching approaches and gain valuable insight into the current
                        English curriculum, but also to observe my students who thrived in ways that I would not observe
                        just delivering ‘Read Write Ink‘, ‘Lit Programme’, ‘Rapid Reader’, ‘Sound Roots’ or ‘SRA’. Very
                        quickly I learnt that holistic approach to each student, together with subject knowledge and
                        robust specialist training were a key to success. Four years later, after a long-awaited Ofsted
                        Inspection in the same school, my teaching provision was rated as very strong and my name was
                        mentioned among the top-performing teachers. At the time, I have been an interim Lead Teacher in
                        Autism Resourced Base, with a thorough level 3 training in supporting verbal students with
                        autism, on my way to complete a level 5 training in supporting students with SpLD/dyslexia
                        whilst teaching a differentiated English and Maths core curriculum for students with additional
                        learning needs. Four years later I have become a teacher able to deliver multi-sensory virtual
                        classes via online platforms and video-conferencing software in an Apple accredited school,
                        where IT is an everyday experience for everybody, and One Drive facilitates students’ electronic
                        exercise books.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Each day at school is a new challenge and I will not stop until I find a solution for each of my
                        tutees.</p>
