    Dyslexia is my main specialism and I have worked in schools specialising in supporting students with dyslexia in both state and independent sectors. To best support any child with dyslexia, a robust assessment is the foundation. Then, each childâ€™s personal needs need to be addressed in a multisensory, structured, and accumulative way. To say it simply- I always plan a well-thought-out program with specific targets, depending on the priorities of the child. This way, the skills will stay in the long-term memory. Another aspect is the technical knowledge and effective use of assistive technology. And lastly- the lessons need to be meaningful for the student. I strive to get to know the child and their interests to make the lessons most productive.
