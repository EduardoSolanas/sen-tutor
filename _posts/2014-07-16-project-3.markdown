description: Most of the students I teach show processing difficulties. To build their confidence, it is important to make teaching relevant to their interests and learning styles, following their natural way of learning and strengthening the areas for improvement.  I devised carefully paced, scaffolded tasks, supported by embedded visuals, 3D props, mindful breaks, and self-reflection summaries. This way, the students consciously participate in their learning, reflect on it, and can see immediate progress, thus boosting their confidence. It is vital that the teaching is also structured and cumulative to support the long-term memory of the students.
