description: >
    For the past 14 years I have been supporting children and young people aged 5 to 16 with additional learning needs, including communication, memory, phonics, reading, spelling, literacy and numeracy difficulties in various subjects: English, Maths, Science, and others, where relevant.
description1: I have experienced and observed teaching in both primary and secondary sectors, and taught SEN students in a mainstream and independent setting (both mainstream and special schools), based on specialist SEN training in specific learning difficulties- dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, ADHD, and speech and language. This goes in line with as an extensive cooperation with educational psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and other school professionals.
description2: I specifically try to keep the parents in the loop along the way- any decision-making needs to tie with mutual understanding and support. My teaching was rated as good, or outstanding in internal and internal inspections.
