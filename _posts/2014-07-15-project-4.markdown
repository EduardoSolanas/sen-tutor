description:  >
    I believe that engaging, personalised and relevant teaching increases students’ focus on learning from the start (please, look at sections regarding motivating, creating fun lessons, anxiety, writing resistance and improving confidence). To additionally improve students’ concentration, a range of sensory and mindfulness tools can be used: short, carefully structured tasks, active or mindful rest breaks, and various props. Creating a sensory profile of each pupil helps to discover the most helpful tools.
